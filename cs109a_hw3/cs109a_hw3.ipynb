    "In this homework, we will explore polynomial regression for predicting a quantitative variable. Specifically, we will build regression models that can predict the percentage change in bacteria population after 4 hours based on their \"spreading factor\". These prediction models can be useful in clustering of a novel bacteria to any class. \n",

In this section we will consider polynomial features of $n=30$, and a **best model** that could be chosen from any possible combination of our 30 degrees.\n",

    "For instance, we could choose a best model with an arbitrary set of polynomial degrees up degree 30, such as $x^i \\in [x^1, x^5, x^{19}, x^{24}]$, rather than the standard approach of using *all* consecutive degrees up to our maximum degree $n=30$ as in $x^i \\in [x^0, x^1, ... , x^{30}]$.\n",
