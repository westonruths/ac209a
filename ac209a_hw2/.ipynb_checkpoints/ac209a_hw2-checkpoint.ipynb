Extremely simple, reductive analysis on sensitive topics such as these can sometimes do more harm than good.

We will be exploring ethics and the potential harms of biases and generalizations in data science in greater depth as we continue throughout this semester."

    "\n",
    "This will help the department flag suspected individuals who may show discernable trends of earing high values of income but are excessively under-reporting on their annual income.\n",

    "As with all other homework problems, this is a learning exercise. And, as absurd or problematic as it might seem to use SimplyMarry.com data for this purpose, in the real world, it will be your decision to choose the types of data science projects on which you will work as well as the clients with which you will work.
